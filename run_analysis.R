## This script creates two tidy files based on a dataset of the
## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Project:
## The script merges the test- and traindata and adds the activity
## description, and writes this into a csv file
## Secondly the above csv file is summarized bij calculating the
## mean of involved colums per subject-activity combination
## Both files are printed and written as CSV files
